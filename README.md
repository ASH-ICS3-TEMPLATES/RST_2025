# ICS3U Final Project: Interactive Web Dev Learning Hub

**Objective:**  
To design and develop an interactive web-based learning hub that showcases your understanding of fundamental web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and core programming principles. You'll create a resource that not only explains these topics but also provides interactive examples to solidify learning.

**Individual Project:** This is an individual assignment.

## Project Goal
Your main goal is to build a user-friendly website that serves as an educational resource for essential computer science and web development concepts. Each core concept (listed below) should have its own dedicated section or page, featuring:
- Clear explanations
- Relevant code snippets
- Interactive demonstrations

## Core Concepts to Cover
Your website must include a distinct section or page for each of the following topics:

### Input/Output (I/O)
- **Explanation:** How websites take information from users and present information back
- **Code Snippets:** HTML forms (`<input>`, `<button>`), JavaScript `prompt()`, `alert()`, `console.log()`, updating `innerHTML`
- **Interactive Example:** Form that takes user input and displays it dynamically

### Variables
- **Explanation:** What variables are and why we use them (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- **Code Snippets:** Declaring and assigning different variable types
- **Interactive Example:** Display that changes when buttons manipulate variables

### CSS (Styling)
- **Explanation:** What CSS is and how it affects websites
- **Code Snippets:** Selectors, properties, and values examples
- **Interactive Example:** Buttons that dynamically change CSS properties

### Functions
- **Explanation:** What functions are and their usefulness
- **Code Snippets:** Defining/calling functions, parameters, return values
- **Interactive Example:** Button that executes a function to perform calculations

### Looping (Iteration)
- **Explanation:** What loops are and their types (`for`, `while`)
- **Code Snippets:** Examples of `for` and `while` loops
- **Interactive Example:** Button that generates a list using a loop

### Conditional Statements
- **Explanation:** What conditionals are (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- **Code Snippets:** Examples of if/else structures
- **Interactive Example:** Light switch toggle or simple quiz with feedback

### DOM Manipulation
- **Explanation:** What the DOM is and how JavaScript interacts with it
- **Code Snippets:** Selecting/changing elements, adding/removing elements
- **Interactive Example:** Buttons that add/remove elements or change content

### Arrays
- **Explanation:** What arrays are and how they store data
- **Code Snippets:** Declaring arrays, accessing elements, array methods
- **Interactive Example:** Simple to-do list that stores tasks in an array

## Technical Requirements

### HTML (Structure)
- Valid HTML5
- Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Each concept in separate section/page

### CSS (Styling)
- Professional, creative styling
- Visually appealing and consistent
- Responsive design principles

### JavaScript (Interactivity)
- JavaScript only
- Well-organized, readable, and commented code
- All interactive examples functional

## Project Deliverables

1. **Project Files (In GitHub)**
2. **README.md File**
   - Your name
   - Project overview
   - How to run/view the website
   - Reflection on learning process
3. Actual webpage created in Pages

## Assessment Rubric

| Criteria | Level 1 (Limited) | Level 2 (Developing) | Level 3 (Proficient) | Level 4 (Exemplary) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Concept Coverage** | Very few (0-3) required concepts addressed, or explanations missing/inaccurate/copied | Some (4-6) concepts addressed with basic/vague explanations, minor inaccuracies | All (8) concepts clearly addressed with accurate, concise explanations | All concepts addressed with exceptional clarity, depth, and insightful analysis |
| **2. Interactive Examples** | Few/non-functional examples that don't demonstrate concepts | Some examples attempted but buggy/confusing/partial functionality | All examples implemented correctly and clearly illustrate concepts | Highly effective, engaging, intuitive examples with strong UX/polish |
| **3. HTML Structure & Validity** | Significant validation errors, disorganized, lacks semantic tags | Some validation errors, basic structure, limited semantic tagging | Valid HTML5, good semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.), logical organization | Flawless HTML5, exceptional semantic structure enhancing accessibility/maintainability |
| **4. CSS Styling & Design** | Minimal styling, poor aesthetics/readability, inconsistent | Basic styling, some consistency, readability issues, limited visual hierarchy | Visually appealing, consistent design, good color/typography/spacing, basic responsiveness | Professional aesthetic, excellent detail, optimal readability, robust responsive design |
| **5. JavaScript Logic** | Significant errors, non-functional, or copied without understanding | Logical flaws/bugs, partial functionality, basic understanding | All JS functions correctly, demonstrates clear understanding | Exceptionally clean/efficient/robust code, handles edge cases, advanced understanding |
| **6. Readability & Comments** | Messy code, no comments, extremely difficult to follow | Inconsistent formatting, few/superficial comments, requires effort to understand | Well-formatted, consistent indentation/naming, clear comments where needed | Exemplary readability, meaningful names, comprehensive insightful comments |
| **7. File Organization** | Disorganized, files scattered randomly, no logical structure | Basic organization, some misplaced files, inconsistent naming | Logical folder structure (`css/`, `js/`, `images/`), files correctly placed | Highly organized, professional structure, intuitive naming conventions |
| **8. Deliverables & Submission** | Missing multiple deliverables or significantly incomplete submission | Missing one key deliverable or minor submission issues | All deliverables included and correctly formatted (`.zip`, `index.html`, `README.md`) | Flawless deliverables, exceptional README, demonstrates high professionalism |
