# ICS3U Final Project: Interactive Web Dev Learning Hub

**Objective:**  
To design and develop an interactive web-based learning hub that showcases your understanding of fundamental web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and core programming principles. You'll create a resource that not only explains these topics but also provides interactive examples to solidify learning.

**Individual Project:** This is an individual assignment.

## Project Goal
Your main goal is to build a user-friendly website that serves as an educational resource for essential computer science and web development concepts. Each core concept (listed below) should have its own dedicated section or page, featuring:
- Clear explanations
- Relevant code snippets
- Interactive demonstrations

## Core Concepts to Cover
Your website must include a distinct section or page for each of the following topics:

### Input/Output (I/O)
- **Explanation:** How websites take information from users and present information back
- **Code Snippets:** HTML forms (`<input>`, `<button>`), JavaScript `prompt()`, `alert()`, `console.log()`, updating `innerHTML`
- **Interactive Example:** Form that takes user input and displays it dynamically

### Variables
- **Explanation:** What variables are and why we use them (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- **Code Snippets:** Declaring and assigning different variable types
- **Interactive Example:** Display that changes when buttons manipulate variables

### CSS (Styling)
- **Explanation:** What CSS is and how it affects websites
- **Code Snippets:** Selectors, properties, and values examples
- **Interactive Example:** Buttons that dynamically change CSS properties

### Functions
- **Explanation:** What functions are and their usefulness
- **Code Snippets:** Defining/calling functions, parameters, return values
- **Interactive Example:** Button that executes a function to perform calculations

### Looping (Iteration)
- **Explanation:** What loops are and their types (`for`, `while`)
- **Code Snippets:** Examples of `for` and `while` loops
- **Interactive Example:** Button that generates a list using a loop

### Conditional Statements
- **Explanation:** What conditionals are (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- **Code Snippets:** Examples of if/else structures
- **Interactive Example:** Light switch toggle or simple quiz with feedback

### DOM Manipulation
- **Explanation:** What the DOM is and how JavaScript interacts with it
- **Code Snippets:** Selecting/changing elements, adding/removing elements
- **Interactive Example:** Buttons that add/remove elements or change content

### Arrays
- **Explanation:** What arrays are and how they store data
- **Code Snippets:** Declaring arrays, accessing elements, array methods
- **Interactive Example:** Simple to-do list that stores tasks in an array

## Technical Requirements

### HTML (Structure)
- Valid HTML5
- Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Each concept in separate section/page

### CSS (Styling)
- Professional, creative styling
- Visually appealing and consistent
- Responsive design principles

### JavaScript (Interactivity)
- JavaScript only
- Well-organized, readable, and commented code
- All interactive examples functional

## Project Deliverables

1. **Project Files (In GitHub)**
2. **README.md File**
   - Your name
   - Project overview
   - How to run/view the website
   - Reflection on learning process
3. Actual webpage created in Pages
